**Theme: Court Reporting Workflow System**

---

## Overview

```yaml
Title: Court Reporting Workflow Manager

Goal: Build a simplified workflow system for managing transcription jobs
```

---

## Core Scenario

```yaml
A court reporting agency receives audio recordings.

They need to:
1. Assign jobs to court reporters
2. Assign editors to review transcripts
3. Track job status
4. Calculate payments
```

---

## Required Features

### 1. Job Management

```yaml
Create a job:
  - case_name
  - duration (minutes)
  - location (physical / remote)
  - status
```

Statuses:

```yaml
NEW → ASSIGNED → TRANSCRIBED → REVIEWED → COMPLETED
```

---

### 2. Reporter Assignment

- Assign job to a reporter
- Reporter attributes:
  - name
  - location
  - availability

Logic:

- Prefer same city for physical jobs
- Allow remote assignment

---

### 3. Editor Assignment

- Assign editor after transcription
- Track review status

---

### 4. Payment Calculation

```yaml
Example rules:
  - Reporter paid per minute (e.g. 2000 IDR/min)
  - Editor paid per job (flat fee)

System should:
  - calculate total payout
  - display per-job earnings
```

---

## Frontend Requirements

- Simple dashboard:
  - job list
  - status
  - assignments

- Basic UI is fine (function > design)

---

## Backend Requirements

- REST API:
  - create job
  - assign reporter/editor
  - update status
  - calculate payment

- Use:
  - Node.js + TypeScript
  - any DB (Postgres preferred, SQLite OK)
